# 10-Day Python Programming Lesson Plan for Beginners


## Day 1: Introduction to Python and Basic I/O

### Overview
Introduced Python and its syntax. Covered basic input/output operations, string manipulation, and simple validation through regular expressions. Implemented a program to read a person's name, validate it, append it to a file, and then display the file's contents.

### Lesson Details
- Discuss what Python is and why it's useful.
- Introduce the concept of variables and strings.
- Explain basic I/O operations (`input()` and `print()`).
- Introduce basic string operations and validation using regular expressions (`re` module).

### Problem
- Implement a program to read a user's name, perform validation, and write to a file.

## Day 2: Data Types and Control Structures

### Objective
Understand different data types in Python and how to control the flow of a program.

### Topics
- Introduction to data types: strings, integers, floats, and booleans.
- Conditional statements: if, elif, and else.

### Problem
- Implement a guessing game that uses these concepts.

---

## Day 3: Collections: Lists and Dictionaries

### Objective
Learn about storing and manipulating collections of data.

### Topics
- Introduction to lists and dictionaries.
- Basic operations: creation, addition, deletion, and access.

### Problem
- Modify the guessing game to allow for multiple attempts
- Modify the guessing game or create a new simple application utilizing lists.

---

## Day 4: Loops

### Objective
Understand how to automate repetitive tasks using loops.

### Topics
- For loops and while loops.
- Looping through collections.

### Problem
- Enhance the previous applications with loops for repeated actions.

---

## Day 5: Functions

### Objective
Learn how to create reusable blocks of code.

### Topics
- Defining and calling functions.
- Arguments and return values.

### Problem
- Refactor the existing code to use functions for better organization.

---

## Day 6: File Handling

### Objective
Dive deeper into file operations.

### Topics
- Reading from and writing to files.
- Working with different file modes (append, read, write).

### Problem
- Create a program that maintains a simple diary.

---

## Day 7: Error Handling

### Objective
Understand how to manage errors and exceptions in a program.

### Topics
- Try and except blocks.
- Handling different types of exceptions.

### Problem
- Update the diary program to handle file and input errors gracefully.

---

## Day 8: Introduction to Classes and Objects

### Objective
Introduce the concept of object-oriented programming.

### Topics
- Defining classes and creating instances.
- Instance variables and methods.

### Problem
- Modify an existing program or create a simple new one using classes.

---

## Day 9: More on Object-Oriented Programming

### Objective
Deepen understanding of object-oriented concepts.

### Topics
- Class inheritance and method overriding.
- Introduction to special methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, etc.).

### Problem
- Enhance the previous day's program with these concepts.

---

## Day 10: Project Day

### Objective
Apply learned concepts in a comprehensive project.

### Topics
- Plan and develop a small application incorporating all learned concepts.
- Possible project ideas: a simple blog, a personal finance tracker, a task manager.
- Review and discuss the project, focusing on areas for improvement and further learning paths.
